The goal of this project is to make a Sous-vide Cooker for less than $50.


The LinkSwitch-TN IC provided by Power Integrations would be a very easy way to provide low voltage DC.
The IC acts as a floating MOSFET with built in control circuitry.  
You just provide a feedback loop with 1.65 Volts and it will act as a non iscolated buck.
All i need to provide is the bridge and a 1mH inductor.  The switch will operate at 66kHz and will have an
output current around 300mA
THis would be more than enough to drive the LCD backlight, gate drivers, and MCUs.
